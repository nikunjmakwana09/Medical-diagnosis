🩺 Medical Diagnosis Web App

A Machine Learning based **Medical Diagnosis Web Application** built using Flask that predicts multiple diseases using trained ML models.

This project allows users to input medical parameters and get instant disease predictions through a simple and interactive web interface.

🔍 Project Overview

This repository contains machine learning models and a Flask web application for predicting various diseases such as:

- ❤️ Heart Disease
- 🫁 Lung Cancer
- 🧠 Parkinson’s Disease
- 🦋 Thyroid Disorder

The models were trained using Jupyter Notebooks and integrated into a Flask web application for real-time predictions.

🚀 Features

✔️ User-friendly web interface  
✔️ Multiple disease prediction models  
✔️ Machine learning-based classification  
✔️ Real-time prediction results  
✔️ Clean and simple project structure  

🧠 Technologies Used

- Python  
- Flask  
- Scikit-learn  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- HTML / CSS

🚀 Run The App

- python app.py

🧪 How It Works

1.The user enters health input through the web form.
2.The backend loads a corresponding trained model.
3.The model predicts the likelihood of a condition.
4.The result is shown back on the UI.
The ML models were trained using Jupyter notebooks and saved for inference in the Flask app.

📈 Future Improvements

✔ Add more disease prediction models
✔ Enhance UI responsiveness
✔ Add real-time feedback and visualization
✔ Improve model performance with larger datasets
